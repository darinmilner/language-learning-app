Security Considerations
S3 Bucket Security:

Enable server-side encryption

Restrict access with bucket policies

Enable versioning for backup and recovery

Certificate Protection:

Private keys are stored encrypted in S3

Use IAM roles with least privilege principle

Regularly rotate access keys and credentials

Network Security:

Use VPC endpoints for S3 access

Implement proper security groups and network ACLs

Monitoring and Logging
CloudWatch Logs:

Monitor Lambda execution logs

Set up alarms for errors and timeouts

S3 Access Logging:

Enable S3 access logging to track certificate access

Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

Step Function Execution:

Monitor Step Function execution history

Set up CloudWatch alarms for failed executions

This implementation provides a secure, automated certificate management solution with S3 storage for certificate artifacts. The solution ensures that certificates are properly stored, managed, and rotated while maintaining security best practices.
